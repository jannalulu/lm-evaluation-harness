# Multi-Round Co-Reference Resolution (MRCR)

### Dataset

HuggingFace dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/openai/mrcr

OpenAI MRCR (Multi-round co-reference resolution) is a long context dataset for benchmarking an LLM's ability to distinguish between multiple needles hidden in context. This eval is inspired by the MRCR eval first introduced by Gemini (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12640v2). OpenAI MRCR expands the tasks's difficulty and provides opensource data for reproducing results.
